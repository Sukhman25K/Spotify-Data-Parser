# About The Project
<img src="https://developer.spotify.com/images/guidelines/design/icon3@2x.png" alt="Spotify's logo">

As a music enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by Spotify's end-of-year Wrapped feature. To delve deeper into my music preferences, I developed a Python script that parses ```JSON``` files containing my Spotify data, which I obtained directly sourced from Spotify's records. The script utilizes basic programming constructs such as loops, if statements and dictionary sorting. Additionally, I integrated the Tkinter module to create a user-friendly interface for selecting the ```JSON``` files.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

```
python --version
```
If Python is not installed, you can do so from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads) by selecting the appropriate installer for your required environment.


## Installation

## Usage
You can go ahead and run the application when it's finished and store it in your local environment. The application can be run in different ways where the first one would be using a terminal. Navigate to the folder where the application is stored and type:
```
python FlashQuiz.py
```

Another way to run the application would be by using an IDLE such as Python's default IDLE or a code editor such as VS code.
