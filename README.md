# About The Project
<img src="https://developer.spotify.com/images/guidelines/design/icon3@2x.png" alt="Spotify's logo">

As a music enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by Spotify's end-of-year Wrapped feature. To delve deeper into my music preferences, I developed a Python script that parses ```JSON``` files containing my Spotify data, which I obtained directly sourced from Spotify's records. The script utilizes basic programming constructs such as loops, if statements and dictionary sorting. Additionally, I integrated the Tkinter module to create a user-friendly interface for selecting the ```JSON``` files.

Features:
- JSON Data Parsing: Easily read and interpret Spotify data in JSON format.
- Insightful Analysis: Gain a comprehensive overview of your yearly music habits.
- Customizable Output: Display diverse statistics and interesting facts about your music preferences.

How It Works:

This Python script is designed to extract and analyze Spotify data collected throughout the year. By processing the JSON files provided by Spotify, it generates detailed 
statistics and interesting information about your music listening patterns.
